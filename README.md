# Agentic-Voice-to-Voice-AI-Assistant-for-Product-Discovery
This project delivers a voice-to-voice, multi-agent assistant that understands spoken requests, plans a solution path, retrieves grounded evidence from a private catalog (Amazon Product Dataset 2020), optionally compares with live web results via MCP tools, and replies via TTS with citations and basic safety checks.
